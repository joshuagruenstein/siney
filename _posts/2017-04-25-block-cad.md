Behold, an ugly mockup of Siney's mechanical construction:

<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/img/block_render.jpeg" data-fluidbox><img
src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/block_render.jpeg" class="figure"></a>

The entire piece at the moment is about 22" wide, 4" long, and 12" tall.  However, it's important to note that the entirety of the design is parametric; by adjusting a single variable such as `roller_radius` or `support_pressure`, all of the components will shift and scale accordingly.  Thus, I retain the right to squeeze and stretch any dimension to my heart's desire.

The structure is constructed out of seven pieces of laser cut 1/4" sheet, likely acrylic.  The back (red), sides (yellow), bottom (green) and top (blue) form a rigid frame, while the support wall (cyan) provides a backing upon which the pen can write.  The paper will loop around the two (yellow) rollers, with the cyan piece encapsulated within the loop.  As such, the back surface of the support piece will not be visible, making it a good candidate for mounting of electronics.

On the front (in translucent purple) is yet another sheet to support the motor upon which the pen-circle rotates.  Although this does not have to be as large as I have made it, I think it'll be aesthetically pleasing to do so.  I do not plan on keeping it as a solid sheet, instead, I plan to cut away 90% of the material, leaving only a negative pattern of triangles or hexagons (I'm yet undecided).  However, as this is a block outline, this detail has not yet been modeled.

## Issues and Solutions

Upon completing this model, I notice a number of tricky spots.  First, the wire management of the front motor seems likely to be tremendously ugly, and I currently don't see a way around that.  Second, machining the rollers is likely to be more of a challenge than expected.  This is because in order to fit with the current design aesthetic, they would have to be machined out of either plastic or metal, both difficult and expensive processes.  Additionally, they need to be able to maintain tension on the paper in order to prevent it from skipping when pen pressure is applied.

This is my current solution to these issues.  Rather than machining the roller out of one solid piece of stock or tube, it would be constructed out of two laser cut acrylic disks, an acrylic tube, and latex tubing.  Because the entire roller isn't machined out of one piece, I'd be able to slip a compressible material (the latex tubing) over the roller to ensure tension without resorting to funky mechanics like tensioning screws.

After sliding on the latex, the acrylic disks would be engraved with the profile of the acrylic tube, such that they could be slotted on and then glued.  Yet another advantage of this system is that I could precisely cut out holes in the roller for the motor shaft and bearings, eliminating the need for set screws and increasing the likelihood of a nice motion.

## Next Steps

In order for the thing to actually fit together, I will have to CAD the puzzle-piece interlocking structure.  Fortunately, the work done to make this rough CAD will be very helpful as a boilerplate for this task, but it is still a fairly laborious process.  Below is an example of this system of construction used for "Muffins," a small robot I co-designed at a competition last fall.  The pieces simply slot together, and are secured using a copious amount of superglue.

I also have to work out the front plate design, add detail to the pen-circle, and add mounting holes for motors.  As I get further into the detail of the project, I'll also have to finalize a bill of materials for the material stock, bearings, bolts, motors, and electronics necessary to complete the sculpture.  For example, the grey blobs currently representing motors are entirely eyeballed in dimension, as I have yet to select the actual stepper motors to be used.

For reference, the code at this moment for the CAD can be found [here](https://github.com/joshuagruenstein/siney/blob/81fb26cf9ce95730110e0c5c533ca2026a05bf08/main.scad).
